          Nina Palumbo creates compositionally technical, atmospheric music
          under the project name "Indisposed". Indisposed songs were originally
          acoustic instrumentals until fall of 2015 when the songs transformed
          into a multi-instrumental project to create a dark spoken-word style
          delivery, with heavy layers of post-rock melody. Since January of
          2017, the band has included Nina Palumbo on guitar and vocals, Daniel
          Saller on Drums ( Ikaray), Rebecca Young on bass ( You Folk.), Sam Kim
          on guitar (Bishop and Tideshift).

          Indisposed.bandcamp.com "Indisposed is an abrasive four-piece
          influenced by screamo, post-rock, math-rock, and spoken-word with
          poly-rhythmic song structures shifting pace between chaotically
          dissonant to melodically haunting."
