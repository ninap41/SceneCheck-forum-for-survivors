            The #MeToo phrase was first coined in 2006 by Tarana Burke, an
            advocate for women in New York. ... Then, in 2017, the phrase was
            reintroduced by actress Alyssa Milano as a way to encourage women
            and men to share their stories as part of an anti-sexual harassment
            movement.

            During this time, The DIY punk scene was inspired; More abuse and
            injustice was called out in facebook groups, forums like deadformat,
            and google docs than ever before. However in 2021, there is no
            platform for the DIY community I could find where people can protect
            their communities.

            This is a safe space where users can contribute anonymously and
            voice their concerns. I'm done with the bullshit. Predators and
            enablers? Nope, #NotInOurScene.

            I have been in the music scene for many years and have had to endure
            the unfortunate power dynamics of being a part of a community that
            strives for inclusion but is not immune to it's wholly white,
            heteronormative, male dominated roots. I have had opportunities
            thrown at me throughout the years. The sad underlying theme of these
            being from people who had more power than myself, each one with
            certain implications or coercion, making me feel like my currency
            for success was not only musical talents, but my sex appeal and
            body. I have been assaulted in the music scene and seen friends,
            queer or non, affected.
